Task 6 Report: Create a Strong Password and Evaluate Its Strength
Objective

The goal of this task is to create multiple passwords of varying complexity, evaluate their strength using password strength checkers, and learn best practices for designing secure passwords that resist common attacks.

**Steps Taken
**
Step 1: Created Multiple Passwords
I generated a few sample passwords with different levels of complexity:

vishal123

Vishal@2025

!Strong_Pa55word!

M9$gT7@xQp#2Z

Step 2: Tested on Password Strength Checker
I used an online password strength checker (such as Kaspersky Password Checker and HowSecureIsMyPassword.net) to test each password.

Step 3: Recorded Scores and Feedback

Step 4: Identified Best Practices
From the results, I identified that the following factors make a password strong:

Use of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters.

Minimum length of 12–16 characters.

Avoiding dictionary words, names, or common patterns (e.g., "12345", "password").

Random combinations rather than predictable substitutions (e.g., "P@ssw0rd" is weak).

Step 5: Tips Learned

Always create unique passwords for different accounts.

Use a password manager to store long and complex passwords.

Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) wherever possible.

Periodically update critical account passwords.

Step 6: Research on Common Password Attacks

Brute Force Attack – Hackers try every possible combination until they guess the password. Weak and short passwords are most vulnerable.

Dictionary Attack – Uses a list of common words/passwords to guess quickly. Simple words or names are easy targets.

Credential Stuffing – Hackers use leaked passwords from other sites to access accounts. Reusing passwords makes users highly vulnerable.

Step 7: Summary of Findings
Password complexity directly affects security:

Weak passwords (short, simple, dictionary-based) are cracked instantly.

Medium-strength passwords offer limited resistance but remain vulnerable.

Strong, random, and long passwords drastically increase resistance against brute force and dictionary attacks, making accounts more secure.

Conclusion

This task demonstrated that password strength is critical in protecting accounts from cyberattacks. A strong password must be long, random, and contain a mix of characters. By combining strong password practices with additional security measures such as MFA, the risk of compromise can be minimized.
